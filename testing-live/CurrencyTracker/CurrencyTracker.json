  "Changelog": "- Added a \"Graphs\" window, where you can browse visualized data in the form of preset models. The initial version includes four types of visual data models: \"Amount Graph\", \"Change Graph\", \"Location Graph\" and \"Location Change Graph\".\n- Made significant changes to the implementation of the multilingual functionality.\n- Modified the plugin logic for the \"Merge Records\" feature when the threshold value is 0. Now, 0 is treated as a flag to ignore the threshold value and perform the merge check directly.",
