(This will not include headers)\n\n## UI Changes:\n* Open Scratch Pads in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI now has a minimum size. (See bug fixes 1)\n* Added a `Show Advanced Settings` option to the settings page to hide and show the more advanced settings of the plugin.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings will now show a message box that gives the user an idea of what kind information to include in a bug report.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings has been renamed to `Found A Bug?`\n* Added a tooltip to the `Buy Me A Ko-Fi` button that explains the nature of the button.\n* Redesigned the `Replace Text Suggestions` list\n\n## Bugs Fixed:\n1. The height of the `Open Scratch Pads` section in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI could become 0 if there was no room left in the window.\n2. Major performance loss with large text entries.\n3. Right clicking on the `Replace Text` input field would cause word wrapping to temporarily break.\n\n## Technical Stuff:\n* PadState class has been moved to the DataTypes.cs file\n* Added more error reporting in an attempt to catch a bug that was reported.\n* Adjusted the way UI is drawn in the ScratchPad (Switching away from tables. No visual difference should be noticeable)\n* Removed some unnecessary `if` statements from the saving settings process.\n* There was a minor calculation issue in the way text was displayed that was causing a massive drop in performance. By changing the way the calculation is handled I was able to bring massive performance gains to Wordsmith. I sincerely apologize to everyone for any performance issues they may have experienced with Wordsmith until this point."

(This will not include headers)\n\n## UI Changes:\n* Open Scratch Pads in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI now has a minimum size. (See bug fixes 1)\n* Added a `Show Advanced Settings` option to the settings page to hide and show the more advanced settings of the plugin.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings will now show a message box that gives the user an idea of what kind information to include in a bug report.\n* The `Bug?` button in Settings has been renamed to `Found A Bug?`\n* Added a tooltip to the `Buy Me A Ko-Fi` button that explains the nature of the button.\n* Redesigned the `Replace Text Suggestions` list\n\n## Bugs Fixed:\n1. The height of the `Open Scratch Pads` section in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI could become 0 if there was no room left in the window.\n2. Major performance loss with large text entries.\n3. Right clicking on the `Replace Text` input field would cause word wrapping to temporarily break.\n\n## Technical Stuff:\n* PadState class has been moved to the DataTypes.cs file\n* Added more error reporting in an attempt to catch a bug that was reported.\n* Adjusted the way UI is drawn in the ScratchPad (Switching away from tables. No visual difference should be noticeable)\n* Removed some unnecessary `if` statements from the saving settings process.\n* There was a minor calculation issue in the way text was displayed that was causing a massive drop in performance. By changing the way the calculation is handled I was able to bring massive performance gains to Wordsmith. I sincerely apologize to everyone for any performance issues they may have experienced with Wordsmith until this point."

This has been refactored as a new method `CreateCompleteText(TextChunk)` in `ScratchPadUI.cs`\n * Added more error dumping to all UI forms.\n * `ScratchPadUI.DrawChunkDisplay()` now factors in `ChunkMarker`'s\n * `ScratchPadUI.DrawChunkItem()` Completely refactored to include `ChunkMarker`'s in the correct places\n * `ScratchPadUI.DrawHistoryItem()` Now grabs `ChunkMarker`'s from settings.\n * `ChatHelper.FFXIVify()` Now factors in all markers.\n * Added more debug commands.\n * Added a `ReplacePlaceholders()` extension method for strings to `Extensions.cs` to ensure predictable behavior.\n * Moved global usings to `Wordsmith.cs`\n * Moved global fields to `Wordsmith.cs`\n * Moved `Global.BUTTON_Y_SCALED` to extension method as int.Scale()\n * Changed the way that settings were reset from a custom reset function to simply replacing the Configuration object with `new()` and saving.\n * Removed several unused members from `ScratchPadUI.cs`\n * Reorganized `ScratchPadUI.cs` members into more logical code regions.\n * Removed `ScratchPadUI.cs` alert system in favor of error window system. Spelling errors are now the only error shown.\n * Added a wrapper method `ImGuiExt.SetHoveredTooltip(string)` for `ImGui.SetTooltip(string)` that bundles the `if (ImGui.IsItemHovered())` check\n * Removed unused packages.\n * Spell checking is no-longer done on its own thread.\n * Added another console command to edit spell check settings.\n * Commented many lines of code that didn't have it and summarized many properties, methods, and functions.\n"
